## Background Story

Sarah has been teaching elementary school for 8 years and loves spending time outdoors with her students during recess and field trips. About two weeks ago, she noticed a new mole on her left forearm that wasn't there before. As someone who's conscious about sun exposure but admits she doesn't always reapply sunscreen during busy school days, she's concerned.

Sarah's mother had a benign mole removed last year, which made her more aware of skin health. She wants to be proactive but doesn't want to overreact. The problem is that getting a dermatologist appointment in Toronto typically takes 3-4 weeks, and she's not sure if her concern warrants immediate attention or if it can wait.
